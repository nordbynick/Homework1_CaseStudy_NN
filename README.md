# Homework #1 - Nick Nordby

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company: 

    Betterment

* When was the company incorporated? 

    2008

* Who are the founders of the company? 

    Jon Stein & Eli Broverman

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? 

    Primarily, Jon Stein's discontent with the securities industry. Stein found personal wealth management to be over complicated, with high barriers to entry, making it more difficult than it needed to be for people to access. Stein also wanted to create a product that promoted good investing behavior and helped people make good money decisions. This latter part was brought to light when Stein was studying behavioral economics in school and realized that he himself was making mistakes managing money. Stein had an epiphany, realizing that even though good financial habits may make sense at a macro level, it is often hard to implement those ideals in day-to-day life. 

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

    Betterment is a private firm funded by equity from venture investors. Betterment received its Series A funding from Bessemer Venture Partners in December 2010. Betterment received its series B funding from Bessemer and Anthemis Group in 2012. In follow-on rounds, additional VCs joined the consortium, including Citi Ventures, Francisco Partners, Globespan Capital Partners, and Kinnevik AB. In total, Betterment has raised $275MM in equity, with its latest round being its Series E. 


## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

    Betterment wants to be the answer to the following question, for ordinary people: "What should I do with my money?".

    From everyday expenses, to cash management products and retirement accounts, Betterment wants to be a one-stop invesment advisor that provides, easy, cheap, and digestible advice that promotes a healthy and sound financial life.

    Through history, there have primarily been two things that prevent people from achieving better financial lives, being: (1) Access to financial products and services, and (2) Financial litteracy. Betterment has set out to create financial products that are both accessible to consumers and, along the way, promote smart decision making. 

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

    Worldwide, the wealth management industry holds $75 trillion in AUM. About half of that amount belongs to institutional investors, while the rest belongs to smaller institutions and individuals.

    Betterment is focused on serving everyday individuals and consumers, providing an array of checking, cash reserve, investing, and retirement products.

    Betterment's advantage primarily comes from being a first mover in its space. While many incumbent institutions are and remain larger (think Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs), Betterment was the first to put technology at the foreground of its investment strategy using roboadvisors and automated systems to place individuals into proper low-cost investments. Betterment gained early success by focusing on a younger demographic that was more adept to change. For some time, larger financial institutions scoffed, believing that people would continue wanting people to manage their investments; however, this has proven to be more expensive and more time consuming in a world that is widely going digital. 

    While products similar to Betterment's are now often offered by other investment advisors, Betterment remains a popular alternative to traditional investment houses. Especially after the 2008 financial crisis, people have grown wary of the status-quo financial instituions. Also, being a relatively smaller tech firm (in comparison to many financial companies), Betterment is more dynamic when it comes to adjusting its image and developing new product.



* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

    Being primarily a robo advisor, based on the efficient-market hypothesis and modern portfolio theory, betterment uses algorithms to allocate and invest client money. Outside of money management, Betterment is highly involved in technologies that provide a safe environment for its clients.

    Popular languages utilized at Betterment are JavaScript, Python, PHP, NGINX, Java, CloudFlare, Ruby, CCS 3, Amazon CloudFront, Google Cloud Platform, Go, Backbone.js, Underscore, and Groovy.

    A recent post on Betterment's Engineering Blog cites the company has been testing its Rails applications to build features more quickly by ensuring higher standards of quality control. Betterment engineers call its tests "specs", of which there are three kinds: model specs, request specs, and system specs. The company uses three types of specs (not more, not less) to ensure applications are sufficiently tested, but not over tested, as to remain efficient. 

    *It should be noted that I do not have an in-depth understanding of what a "spec" test is, but for the purpose of this Case Study I found Betterment's article to be interesting.

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

    Wealth Management, Money Management, Consumer Checking & Deposits

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

    A shift to robo advisors and fee compression. Automated investment advise and asset allocation have been a major trend in the investment industry. This trend also allows large financials to reduce headcount and lower fees; however, it is a double-edged sword as intense competition and automation has led to severe fee compression in the finance industry. 

    Part of technology's enablement of fee compression is related to the fact we now simply know more about finance. Using statistical models we can better allocate funds amongst investment products based on an individuals risk profile. While not perfect, that has allowed for widespread automation. The effecient-market hypothesis & modern portfolio theory, in essence, can be calculated and implemented by computers in a cost efficient manner.

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

    Best Robo Advisors: Betterment; Wealthfront; SoFi; Ellevest; Blooom

    Incumbents Catching-Up: Merrill Lynch (Merrill Edge); TD Ameritrade; Schwab; E*TRADE



## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

    Betterment was at the forefront of socially responsible investment firms utilizing technology. As such, Betterment, along with other players such as Wealthfront, has helped spur the robo advisor evolution. Outside of the technology piece, Betterment has helped provied low-cost investment advice and products to thousands of individuals, helping promote better financial lives for its clients. 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

    The core metrics form a business aspect would be: (1) Assets Under Management ("AUM"), and (2) Number of Customers. Beyond these two metrics, the company would be analyzed based on different profit margins to determine how effeicient it is at growing and managing AUM.

    Given Betterment is private, these numbers aren't always widely available, but in 2020 Betterment reported greater than $22 billion in AUM and 500,000+ users.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

    Wealthfront, Betterment's primary competitor, is also private; however, in 2019 it reported $20 billion in AUM, meaning that Wealthfront and Betterment are on par with each other.


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

    I would recommend that Betterment pair up with Intuit to become the one-stop-shop for everything. I think that, in particular, the addition of a tax manager (Intuit owns the TurboTax product) would be a boon to Betterment's product offering.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

    Building on the above recommendation, filing taxes are often an arduous process and investment information is often requested when filling out a tax return. If Betterment took the "Amazon" approach and offered all things money-related, beyond investments, it would set itself apart. In some ways, Betterment has already done this by offering high-yield checking accounts and debit cards. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

    To offer the TurboTax product, engineers would likely be refined to figuring out the kinks of product integration; however, it is likely that the use of APIs (application programming interface) would be helpful. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

    While my understanding of APIs is limited, I believe that the TurboTax software, once integrated, could hit on Betterment's APIs, retrieving the proper and necessary information needed to fill out tax forms with information related to investments and cash management.
